            <h1>This page is about juice</h1>
            <p>I fucking LOVE juice. I really want juice right now, but i dont have it. <br>
            This left me with extremely limited options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aquire Juice</li>
                <li>Cope without Juice</li>
                <li>Waffle about Juice on the page i have to create for the practical</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Logically, I went with the third option. I will probably buy more juice immediately after this.</p>
